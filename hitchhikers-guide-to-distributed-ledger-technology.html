We think of blockchain as a type of DLT, in the same way that a Kleenex is a type of tissue. The popularity and early adoption has caused both terms to often be used interchangeably. For most casual purposes, this is fine. For us, DLT is a suite of technologies and the application of these technologies to solve business solutions. Its primary features are 1) it runs on the internet 2) it consists of a series of nodes that distribute and verify all of the ledgers in the system 3) it requires security solutions to ensure the integrity of the data and prevent malicious actors and 4) its value proposition is that it disintermediates many middleman functions. 
</p><p>Blockchain is a specific type of DLT with a unique and specific set of features. It has a decentralized database. Its database is shared by means of blocks that form a chain. A block is a packet of information that is protected by a cryptographic signature called a ‘hash’. Each subsequent block in time begins with the same hash, which is the mechanism that ensures the encrypted information has not, and cannot, be manipulated. The most famous, as well as the first, application of blockchain technology is Bitcoin currency. This is the reason the term Bitcoin, blockchain and DLT are often conflated. To be clear, bitcoin is a cryptographic currency, which uses blockchain technology, which is a very specific type of distributed ledger technology. 
</p><p>There are two more terms to define. The first is ‘algorithm’. An algorithm is a sequence of instructions to be completed by a computer. The second is ‘peer-to-peer’ (P2P) systems, or networks. A P2P system consists of distributed software to a set of nodes, the number of which is usually unknown, which makes their computational resources directly available to one another. P2P networks are the key to disintermediation. However, a P2P network cannot exist on its own. This network must maintain its integrity in an environment of unknown trustworthiness, especially when there is great incentive and opportunity for malicious actors within the environment. We address this here.</p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10">The original application of blockchain technology was Bitcoin. Blockchain was the key technology that bitcoin sat on and was first introduced in Satoshi Nakamoto’s seminal 2008 white paper “Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System”. Bitcoin was described as a “purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash”, and the key problem that blockchain solved was how to ensure digital trust in an open and uncertain (from trustworthy perspective) environment. It took some time for the marketplace to recognize blockchain technology’s use cases away from the cryptocurrency (“coin”) application. The key characteristics that allows blockchain to be applied independently from cryptocurrencies are: 1) it can be applied to any asset, not just currency and tokens 2) anonymity is not required for blockchain to work and 3) in a non-anonymous, non-currency, application consensus can be achieved via selective endorsement as opposed to proof of work. These differences will become important when thinking about appropriate applications. 
<div><br></div><div>Upon recognizing blockchain’s ability to establish digital trust, the door was opened for many other blockchain applications above and beyond the world of cryptocurrency. Creating an open, decentralized ledger that records transactions between parties in a permanent way without needing third party authentication, allows practitioners to create networks that significantly reduce transaction costs by cutting out as many of the middle men as possible. It also can be used to solve work flow inefficiency problems. Finally, the market is beginning to recognize a secondary benefit for non-coin applications as well. Database scientists are rapidly expanding their use of DLT to organize, store and retrieve data in many new and exciting ways.

There are a host of other trust models that can also be used within DLT. This includes Proof of Stake, Proof of Importance, Tangle, PBFT and DBFT. In addition to achieving consensus thru mining, system architecture can provide elements of digital trust. The most common being full or partial centralization of the P2P. Centralization can take the form of white lists, clearing corporations, regulatory oversight to name a few. There are pro’s and con’s to achieving trust thru centralization. Purists see decentralization as a key libertarian goal, while business practitioners are more agnostic. The choice made here should be best fit for purpose. 
</p><p></p><div>To summarize: P2P systems are the key to unlocking value in the ecosystem by removing middlemen, thus efficiently processing and recording transactions and as a result reducing transaction costs. Blockchain is the technology that uses cryptographic hash functions in a sequential order as Proof of Work (POW) for the purpose of establishing the digital trust required for market actors to transact confidently in the ecosystem. DLT is the suite of technologies which allows the P2P system to interact in a robust, secure, decentralized and usable manner. More succinctly, the purpose of P2P system is to increase efficiency and reduce transaction costs, DLT solutions exist to provide the trust in, and integrity of, the system. Blockchain is a specific solution that uses cryptographic hash functions in POW as one element of providing trust to a P2P system.</div><p></p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>When documenting ownership of a digital asset, it is useful to differentiate between inventory data and transaction data. Inventory data is the stating of assets and identifying which party has claim to said assets. This describes any sets of assets and the claims related to those assets at any unique point in time. Transaction data provides the functionality of explaining and justifying the changes to claims on assets and is useful in describing the history of changes in ownership over a period of time. Both concepts are critical elements in protecting ownership when it is most vulnerable: during the transfer of ownership.</p><p>During the period of vulnerability when ownership is transferred, there are 6 pieces of information required to minimize this vulnerability. </p><p><em><strong>1.</strong> ID seller (i.e. account #). </em></p><p><em><strong>2.</strong> ID buyer (also account #). </em></p><p><em><strong>3.</strong> Amount of goods to be transferred. </em></p><p><em><strong>4.</strong> Time of the transaction. </em></p><p><em><strong>5.</strong> Fee paid to the system. In a typical DLT system, users will tell the system, in advance, how much they would pay for a transaction. </em></p><p><em><strong>6.</strong> Proof that the seller agrees to transfer ownership.</em></p><p>These 6 pieces of data need to be augmented with additional protocols to provide robust security during transfer. First, the system must maintain order, in a time based manner. Second, formal correctness is required, i.e. all fields must be populated. Third, the system must be designed with semantic correctness, i.e. there must be a correct business understanding of the fields required. Finally, there must be an authorization from the seller that says it’s ok to complete the transaction. There is a subtle distinction between this final criteria and information item #6 in the previous paragraph. Proof that a seller agrees to transfer could be a signed contract that says if $100 hits my account by 5pm, I will transfer ownership, whereas authorization from the seller would be the seller seeing the $100 hit the account and saying transfer is approved.</p></div>

System integrity reinforces human trust in the overall ecosystem, and is critical to the adoption, use and long term success of any platform. Achieving system integrity through data structure requires two core concepts. 
</p><p>One core concept is that more independent witnesses verifying ownership is better. Verifying ownership means identifying the owner, the object being owned and then mapping the owner to the object. This mapping can be done via ledger or register. Ownership has two main elements, proof of ownership, and use of ownership. For proof of ownership, the data structure has to include mapping, and identification, which properly id’s both the property and the owner. For use of ownership, the data structure must account for authentication, which is similar to providing a password, and authorization, which is analogous to providing a signature.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>The second core concept is transparency. System architects must have a clear policy stating their position on transparency, which increases integrity and trust on the platform, versus privacy, which is a critical element for businesses wishing to transact in the marketplace. System architects must also decide if the platform will prove ownership, allow the transfer of ownership, or a combination of both. Another transparency design consideration is deciding who can read the ledgers and how they can access them, versus who is allowed to write to the ledger, as well as the protocols required to make writing to the ledger robust, safe and secure. The final transparency consideration is how to purely distribute the ledger in which a majority of the peers on the network agree. 
</p><p>It is often the case when designing something new that only the current use case is considered. This may lead to an optimal solution for the current problem, but may restrict future use cases down the road, or at the very least require patches, adaptations and code changes later. No one person can think of every potential future use case, however the infrastructure and data collection and storage of any DLT system solution lends itself very strongly to factoring, peer-to-networking lending, and securitization use cases. Time spent considering these potential future uses during the planning phase of development would be a wise investment. &nbsp;</p></div>

The common elements of all obstacles is that they introduce a threat to the trust in the system, the integrity of the system, or both. Each obstacle can be further categorized as the result of either technical failures or malicious actors. The main problem for system architects is designing a system in which there are an unknown number of nodes in the system, and trustworthiness of each node is also unknown. In the case of an open, truly decentralized system, not only are these both unknowns, but they are unknowable always, as new nodes are constantly added and removed from the system. 
<div>
</div><div>The system architect must also consider three common problems that threaten the trust and integrity of their system. They are widely known as the Double Spending Problem, the Byzantine General’s Problem and the 51% Attack. We’ll briefly review each here, but leave investigation of the ways to combat and prevent each to future investigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div>

This is not the case with digital assets. Digital assets can “buy two packs of gum at once” in one of two ways. One way is by the copying of the digital good and having that copy appear in the distributed, and consensus approved, ledgers. When copying digital goods, the malicious actor has in fact duplicated a digital asset, as opposed to creating a reasonable facsimile of one. This violates the integrity of system by creating inconsistency in the data. 
</p><p>The second way a double spend could occur is by taking advantage of the time it takes for a transaction to happen and the system determining the new consensus ledger and distributing it to the system. Flaws in design could allow for a digital good to be “sold” to two parties at the same time, and have both transactions become part of the approved consensus ledger. This threatens the integrity of the system by introducing doubt as to true ownership, as well as the loss incurred by at least one of the parties that paid for a digital good they will not receive.</p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>The Byzantine General’s Problem (BGP) is a classic problem faced by any distributed computer system network. Using a fictitious historical event as an example, the Byzantine Empire that has decided to capture a city. The city is surrounded, but won’t surrender and is capable of putting up a devastating fight that could cripple the Byzantine army. The key to taking the city and keeping the army intact is for the surrounding army to act completely in unison. They must either all attack at once, or if resistance is too fierce, they all must retreat at the same time. If either action is not done simultaneously, then the army faces complete annihilation.</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The army is led by commanders, who can give orders to lieutenants, who give orders to the men. In the case of BGP, some of the commanders and lieutenants are actually enemy spies, and actively want the Byzantine army to fail. To achieve their nefarious ends, they can either disobey the message or they can transmit the message to the next lieutenant incorrectly. In the applied case of DLT systems, there are only lieutenants, no commanders, but it doesn’t change the crux of the problem. That crux is “how do you get every lieutenant (node) to agree and act upon every message that is transmitted between them?” The answer lies with algorithms that have been created which require highly computationally expensive replications in order to retransmit the message, and there needs to be a critical majority of retransmissions in agreement in order for the message to be agreed upon as true. Blockchain, and its Proof of Work algorithms are the most famous of these solutions. The major weakness in this solution is the vulnerability to the system when more than 50% of lieutenants are spies.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

This weakness was identified in the earliest days with the birth of Bitcoin, but it was assumed that the protocols employed via cryptography and the cost of computation (aka “mining”) would make any hacking attempt uneconomical in the extreme, and thus the system was safe from hackers. Recently however, the number of attacks on specific DLT systems, specifically cryptocurrency has been increasing. This is largely due the change in economics (from boom to bust for most, if not all cryptocurrencies). Any system designed for business must be cognizant of the 51%, and prepare multiple layers of defense.
