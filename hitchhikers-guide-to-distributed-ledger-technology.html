            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>An understanding of the US cannabis industry has to start with its legal history. Prior to the early 20th century, cannabis didn’t have any prohibitions. In two surprising ironies, prohibition began on the state level, and it was Massachusetts in 1911 followed by California in 1913 leading the charge. A number of states followed suit, banning and criminalizing marijuana up until 1937. That year the Marijuana Tax Act was enacted, effectively prohibiting cannabis at the federal level. The act allowed some exceptions for medical use, though fees and regulations significantly curtailed its use. In 1970, the Controlled Substances Act was passed, which officially prohibits cannabis for any use at the federal level. Marijuana became a Class 1 narcotic.
</p><p>After 1970, some states slowly began an effort to decriminalize cannabis. The strategy focused on decriminalization, as opposed to legalization, as pro-cannabis forces realized small incremental changes would be more likely to be accepted than sweeping overhauls. Oregon acted first in 1973, reducing the penalty of possession to a monetary fine. In 1978, New Mexico passed the Controlled Substances Therapeutic Research Act, opening the door for medical marijuana research and applications. As other states passed limited medical cannabis laws and pushed for decriminalizing the use of cannabis the tension between State and Federal laws increased. The conflicts were limited to medical use and decriminalization, as opposed to recreational use and legalization, so there was not much impetus for action.a</p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>That changed in 1996, when California became the first state to legalize medical cannabis with the passage of Proposition 215. Legalization versus decriminalization marked a pivotal divergence between state and federal authorities, but again, pushing for only medical use reduced the incentive for Federal lawmakers and enforcers to fight with much vigor. It was a masterful strategy, and as a result, a handful of other states followed California’s lead, with varying degrees of success up until 2012. That year marked the first state efforts to legalize the recreational use of cannabis. For the first time since 1970, states’ rights versus federal rights takes center stage for the average citizen. By this time, society’s attitudes had shifted significantly towards a positive view of marijuana, which provided the opportunity for legitimate business expansion. But in order to capture business from a pro-cannabis population, the business community now has to navigate the often conflicting legal environments on the state versus federal levels.</p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>How does a legal business entity in Colorado continue to operate legally on the federal level? First and foremost is the question of taxes, as no legitimate business wants to run afoul of the IRS. But even before paying the “proper” taxes, how a does a business process transactions? If the Colorado business buys empty cartridges on a credit card from a near-by business that is across state lines, have they committed a federal crime? Has the bank behind the credit card transaction committed a crime? These are serious topics, and there is a lot of evidence that the risk is not worth any potential reward, particularly from the perspective of the banking community.
</p><p>It is estimated that the legal marijuana business recently hit $9BB USD in sales. Of those businesses involved, only 30% have bank accounts. Putting aside the logistic and security concerns that ~$6BB in cash transactions would entail, why would banks turn down such large chunks of business? The short answer is criminal prosecution and regulatory punishment.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10">The long answer is even more ominous for banks. Any bank that provides services to a marijuana business could face possible criminal prosecution for “aiding and abetting” criminal activity and is particularly susceptible to Anti-Money Laundering Laws. This is in addition to potential regulatory punishment from the Treasury Department for failure to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, as well as independent bank regulators who can impose civil monetary penalties, fines, cease-and-desist orders and banishments. Listing on US stock exchanges is not an option. All of which makes the requirement to submit Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR) for every transaction with a marijuana business seem like expensive child’s play. Given all this, the real surprise is that 30% of marijuana businesses are actually given banking accounts at all.</div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10">The legal and regulatory environment has led to many US marijuana businesses joining the ranks of “The Unbanked”. Without access to banking services, including lending, bank accounts and payment processing, these businesses are severely restricted. They most often lack funding to scale their business. The lack of liquidity and access to credit, makes regular business functions difficult, and expansion is also severely restricted. Businesses are forced to revert to cash-n-carry business practices, which are logistically prohibitive. For example, $10,000 USD composed entirely of $20’s is 2.15 inches thick. The $20 dollar bill is also the most frequently counterfeited bill in the US. Cash-n-carry business practices are also prohibitive from a safety and security perspective. These businesses are prime candidates for robbery, assault and fraud crimes. Entities try to limit their risk by reducing the number and size of their transactions, or incur the additional costs of security and verification.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10">The explosion of the cannabis industry in Canada is obviously a result of its universal (in Canada) legality, however even in Canada US Federal laws inhibit growth. Most Canadian based companies have used access to capital markets via the stock exchanges to raise the funds needed to scale business. This is a onetime capital injection. For daily business operations, the services of the banking system are required. Most banks are international, and risk averse, particularly when it comes to US banking laws and regulations. This makes banks reluctant to facilitate cross border transactions. The clear cut illegal activities are easy to avoid, but it’s the grey areas that cause the most concern. Consider the Canadian company that wants to source its packaging and containers from a US company? All cannabis adjacent activities must submit SAR reports, and run the risk of AML laws among other negative consequences. As a result, even in places where cannabis is fully legal, US Federal laws have a strong gravitational pull. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

We address this question here. 2) Will the US maintain cannabis illegality long enough on the Federal level to make any investment in solving #1 worthwhile? Another way to frame the second part of the question is to ask if the US Federal situation changes in the near future to make cannabis fully federally legal, will any of the solutions provided in part 1 of the question still have commercial value worth the investment. This question is addressed here.
