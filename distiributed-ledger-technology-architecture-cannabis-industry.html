We stand by that assessment. But any solution that attempts to circumvent and end run the banking and legal systems is doomed to fail, and spectacularly so. We are firm believers in “render undo Caesar what is his”. Given this outlook, we look to reformulate the primary issue facing cannabis companies in a way that allows businesses to provide meaningful economic and legal solutions. 
</p><p>If you strip away all the many financial features and services that banks provide to businesses, the main bank functionality is the introduction of TRUST to a network of buyers and sellers and producers and consumers. The store owner is confident enough to let a customer walk out of their store with one of their goods after swiping a piece of plastic thru a machine because they TRUST that they will be paid. That is a powerful idea, and a very valuable service. But it is not the exclusive domain of the banking industry. Let’s examine a few examples to how works. 
</p><p>The cash-n-carry business model puts severe limitations on market participant. The logistics of large amounts of cash, combined with the risk of theft, restricts most fiscally responsible business owners. Even if the amount of cash could be carried in a single bill, and no criminals ever existed, the use of cash for business constricts that business’s ability to grow and expand. The introduction of trust, via the mechanisms of credit and liquidity, is one of the most compelling use cases for a DLT solution in the cannabis industry.&nbsp;</p></div>

        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>Here’s how it works. There are four major ways to introduce trust into a network, via credit and liquidity. Those are: extend days to pay, conditional volume discounts, performance guarantees and introducing margins structure. We’ll address each way in detail in due course, here we will highlight two points. First, each way changes either the timing of the payment, the amount of the goods in the transaction, or the risk of loss. Second, each of these ways has an exact compliment in the main street business world, except the problem and the solution are inverted. 
</p><p>For example, on “Main Street”, the manufacturer who makes board games “sells” their product to big box distributors, but big box distributors do not have to pay the bill for 30, 60 or 90 days in the future. Meanwhile, the board game manufacturer has weekly payrolls and monthly utility bills, etc., and needs the money now. To get this money, the manufacturer may need to take a small business loan, usually at a high rate of interest. Meanwhile, the big box distributor is sitting on a pile of cash, with limited opportunities to earn return on that cash on a short duration horizon. In this main street example, economic value can be extracted for all parties by compressing the payment delay. There are real world solutions currently addressing this. 
</p><p>In the world of cannabis, and any cash-n-carry business, the exact opposite problem exists. A vape pen distributor has orders to fill 100,000 THC oil infused cartridges, and could sell them for $10 apiece, wholesale. The oil required to fill the order costs $500,000. Each empty cartridge costs $2. The vape pen distributor only keeps $100,000 of cash on hand, and as such cannot possibly meet the full extent of demand. If the order is all-or-none, the distributor has just lost a $200k profit (you must subtract labor, distribution, etc.). Efficient market economists will conjecture that this demand will be met by other vape pen distributors. But the point is that this market is not efficient, because transactions requiring large amounts of cash immediately are not efficient, and thus economic opportunity is lost. 
</p><p>In the vape pen example, extended days for payment would be an excellent solution. The pen distributor could buy the cartridges and oil on 60 day payment, get delivery within a week, have the cartridges filled and distributed mere days later. Now the purchaser of the filled cartridges would be faced with the same dilemma, i.e. paying in full in cash. The pen distributor could offer a few potential solutions: the buyer could pay in 30 days, which would benefit everyone involved, or the buyer could pay on margin, which is to say, pay some percentage of the total immediately and the rest 60 days later. If the buyer paid the pen distributor $700,000, then the pen distributor would have some cash on hand for ~40 days, and still be able to pay both the oil producer and the cartridge maker, and their only risk is the loss of labor and profit. If cartridges are normally $10 a piece, the pen distribution could propose to buyer that paying in 30 days or less would reduce the unit cost is reduced to $9. Finally there could be an investor or marketplace of investors who would be willing to provide a performance guarantee on said transaction for 10% of the value at risk. All of these solutions are viable independently or in conjunction with one or more other solutions. The beauty of this framework is that those who can best bear the risk, as indicated by the price at which they are willing to sell it, will bear that risk, while those unable to bear the risk have an outlet to offset that risk. This is capitalism at its absolute best. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>

They are all useful metrics for making decisions on who to interact with, and on what terms. A well designed DLT system can capture similar information on market participants. More importantly, that information can be used to the benefit of all beneficent actors within the network. Just a good FICO score can get you a better interest rate on a car loan, so too can a good credit profile for a business within the network provide better terms. Those better terms can come in many forms, such as improved conditional volume discounts (instead of buy 10 get 1 free, you may get 2 free), longer extensions of payment delay (from 30 days to 60 day), lower margin requirements ( only need 20% down payment, as opposed to 40%) or a performance guarantee that only costs 600bps instead of 800bps.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>Back end risk management, or back office risk management, describes all the functions of the business that are not client facing. These functions are the lifeblood of any business. When done well, it is often underappreciated. When the back office experiences failures, it can cripple a company. Some back office functions include finance and accounting, checking payment requests, vendor additions, client invoicing and capex approvals. DLT systems can be applied usefully to all of these functions, primarily through efficient processing and tracking of large amounts of data. However, there are two Back End Risk management realms where DLT solutions can really provide significant added value. Those realms are Netting Risk Management and Default Management.
</p><p>Netting Risk Management is defined as offsetting the value of 2 or more transactions, payments or positions in order to create a single value. It is a widely used method for reducing a number of the risks from financial contracts. Those risks include credit risk, systematic risk, settlement risk and liquidity risk. There are four main types of netting: payment netting (aka settlement netting), novation netting, close out netting and multilateral netting. Novation netting is a more legal, formal version of payment netting used by financial firms, while close out netting becomes effective upon a default by one of the parties. Both of these types can be examined at a later time; it is the payment netting and multilateral netting that are most relevant at the moment. 
</p><p>With payment netting, the only payment required is the difference in aggregate amount owed between two. For businesses facing the limitations of a cash-n-carry ecosystem, payment netting can be a very effective tool in increasing the efficiency of settlement, as well as the logistics of cash management. Payment netting can be done formally in a Master Agreement with a Payment Netting Clause, slightly less formally with a standalone Payment Netting Agreement or in an informal “ad hoc” arrangement. These are most often done via bilateral netting agreements between two parties. Whichever route is chosen, the end result is the reduction of settlement risk, and a significantly reduced cash usage requirement. Multilateral netting is similar in concept to payment netting, except multilateral nettings occurs between more than 2 parties. Because of this added layer of complexity, most multilateral netting arrangements occur on an exchange. 
</p><p>Default management includes all the steps in the process to identify, prevent, mitigate and ultimately resolve the issues that occur when a party approaches default or actually defaults. To identify and prevent defaults, businesses can track performing, sub-performing and non-performing accounts. To mitigate or resolve accounts at risk, businesses can design work out plans and anticipate cash flows that will impact pending transactions with other partners. If that is not feasible, they can begin the foreclosing on the collateral and anticipate recovery rates. All of this can be greatly benefitted by an intelligent and robustly designed DLT system.&nbsp;</p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>Once you start combining transaction histories, with credit profiles and a back end risk management system, you have all the building blocks in place to make better business decisions. The first order business decision is always to avoid catastrophic loss, and hopefully that case has been made evident. The second order is to recognize opportunity for growth and profit. From a conceptual perspective, this means recognizing opportunities as soon as possible, minimizing opportunity costs and deploying investment into the enterprises and activities with the risk/reward profile that best fits your individual business model. From a practical application perspective, the information contained within your own business that is captured by a DLT system may reveal that even though you think you’re making a lot of money with the big bulky customer, you are actually getting better margins and more consistent business with a customer who buys smaller amounts but more often and quite regularly. Conversely, you may determine that clients with particular credit profiles are willing to pay “bad credit” rates for access to credit, while their prepayment and default characteristics are more in line with a “good credit” customer and that the market has not yet adjusted to the new information. Here, you can offer this person better terms, without taking on more risk, thereby providing both the business and the client economic improvement.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>In the world of finance, it’s often joked that the only two ways to make money are leverage and securitization, and there’s certainly a kernel of truth in that. The introduction of credit and liquidity is the equivalent of leverage, and leverage is almost always the first financial tool introduced to emergent industries. Throughout recent history, we have seen almost every asset class adopt some aspect of securitization. From mortgages to car loans, student loans to aircraft leases, asset classes across the spectrum have benefited from the securitization process. When done correctly, everyone wins. Investors get access to new opportunities, which in terms lowers the rates and cost for the borrowers, which allows for more transactions for the producers, and ultimately more value for the society as a whole. We believe introducing credit and liquidity to the cannabis industry is a prerequisite for securitization. We also believe once credit and liquidity are established, securitization will quickly follow. We will have more to say on securitization in the future.

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-10"><p>A strong case can be made for imminent legalization of medical and recreational marijuana in the United States. If that happens, and the banking industry is allowed to provide all their services to the cannabis industry, won’t any investment in DLT solutions now be wasted? It’s our opinion that nothing could be further from the truth. First, DLT system solutions, just like the cannabis industry, are a new and expanding industry. Innovations are being developed every day, and industry leaders are thinking of new applications and use cases regularly. Any investment in DLT solutions for the cannabis industry will be an opportunity for each industry to learn from each other, and new innovations and applications will inevitably result. US federal legalization won’t revoke any of that intellectual property. Second, we fully embrace US Federal legalization, and would happily partner with any banks that wished to expand. We believe it is still way too early for a winner take all marketplace, and the best and most robust solutions will be the result of collaboration, and not first to market strategies. Not to mention, by design, this solution gains strength and increases with value as the network expands. Including the banking sector would only make any existing solution that much more valuable to all participants. In addition, while some banks have DLT research, development and strategy departments, many do not, and many of those will be looking to adopt working, off the shelf solutions. A working proof of concept, not to mention a viable business model, would be an attractive commodity in a post-legalized world. Finally, members of the cannabis industry have a long history of being ignored and shunned by the banking community. Overcoming a history of mistrust and mutual dislike will not happen overnight. We very much look forward to the time when these groups work harmoniously together, but we are pragmatic enough to know that emissaries will provide a valuable function.
